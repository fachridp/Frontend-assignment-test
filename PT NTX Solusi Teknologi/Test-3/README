## TEST 3

Problem Statement:
You are working as a developer at an e-commerce company that uses Vue.js for their
application. Your task is to implement a product management feature with the following
requirements:
1. You need to implement a feature to calculate the total price of a product category,
including all its subcategories recursively. Categories can nest indefinitely.
2. Make sure to consider product categories that might not have subcategories or products.
Also, there are categories that have subcategories but no products directly under them.
3. The backend uses GraphQL to manage data. You need to implement GraphQL operations
to fetch, add, edit, and delete products and categories.
4. Use Pinia or Vuex to manage the application's state, including products, categories, and
loading status.
5. Implement all features in a Vue.js application.
6. Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) features for products and categories.
Your Task:
Create Vue.js components to display, add, edit, and delete products and categories using
GraphQL operations.
